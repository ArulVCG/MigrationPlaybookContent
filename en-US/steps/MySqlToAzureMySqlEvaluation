Migrating from an on-premises instance of MySQL, a MySQL instance hosted in a virtual machine, or an RDS MySQL instance to Azure Database for MySQL is considered a homogeneous migration. Azure Database for MySQL automatically manages patching for minor version updates. Azure Database for MySQL supports a variety of MySQL versions using the InnoDB engine. If you are running a supported version of on-premises MySQL, the database will be fully compatible and the migration will be relatively straightforward.

For a current listing of supported versions, see the article [Supported MySQL database versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-supported-versions).

If you have MyISAM tables, convert them to InnoDB before you migrate them to Azure Database for MySQL. For more information, see the MySQL article [Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/converting-tables-to-innodb.html).
