<!-- Assess -->

When the data sources have been identified, the next step is to assess on-premises SQL Server instance(s) migrating to Azure SQL database(s) to understand the gaps between the source and target instances. Use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess your source database before migrating to Azure SQL Database.

### Overview of assessment steps

An overview of the steps associated with using DMA to create an assessment follows.

1. Open the Data Migration Assistant (DMA), and then begin creating a new assessment project.

2. Specify a project name, select **SQL Server** as the source server type, and then select **Azure SQL Database** as the target server type.

3. Select the type(s) of assessment reports (database compatibility and feature parity) that you want to generate.
    - The SQL Server feature parity category provides a comprehensive set of recommendations, alternative approaches available in Azure, and mitigating steps to help you plan the effort into your migration projects.
    - The Compatibility issues category identifies partially supported or unsupported features that reflect compatibility issues that might block migrating on-premises SQL Server database(s) to an Azure SQL Database managed instance. Recommendations are also provided to help you address those issues.

4. Specify the source connection details for your SQL Server, connect to the source database, and then start the assessment.

5. When the process is complete, review the assessment reports for migration blocking issues and feature parity issues by selecting the specific options.

6. Determine the database compatibility level that you want to minimize your efforts after migrating to Azure SQL Database.

7. Identify the best Azure SQL Database managed instance SKU for your on-premises workload.
