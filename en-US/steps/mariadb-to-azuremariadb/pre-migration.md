## Pre-migration overview

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

## Discover

The goal of the Discover phase is to identify existing data sources and details about the features that are being used to get a better understanding of and plan for the migration. This process involves identifying all your organizationâ€™s MariaDB instances along with the version and features in use.

## Assess

When the data sources have been identified, the next step is generally to assess the source MariaDB instance(s) migrating to Azure Database for MariaDB to understand the gaps between the source and target instances.

## Convert

For heterogenous migrations (such as Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL), the Pre-migration stage also involves converting the schema(s) in the source database(s) to be compatible with the target environment. For homogenous migrations, such as MariaDB to Azure Database for MariaDB, conversion of the source schema to work in the target environment is not required.
