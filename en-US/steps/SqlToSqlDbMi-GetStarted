<!--Preparing for database migration-->

As you prepare for migrating your database to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Overview
This scenario describes how to migrate a SQL Server instance to an Azure SQL Database managed instance. 

### Offline versus online migrations
When you migrate SQL Server databases to Azure by using Azure Database Migration Service, you can perform an offline or an online migration. With an *offline* migration, application downtime begins when the migration starts. For an *online* migration, downtime is limited to the time required to cut over to the new environment when the migration completes. It's recommended to test an offline migration to determine whether the downtime is acceptable; if not, perform an online migration.

### Supported versions

This section describes all supported scenarios and options for an upgrade from on-premise SQL Server versions to an Azure SQL Database managed instance. This information is current as of March 2019.

Details for migrations to an Azure SQL Database managed instance from the following SQL Server sources are included:
* SQL Server 2005
* SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2
* SQL Server 2012
* SQL Server 2014
* SQL Server 2016
* SQL Server 2017

The following data migration options are discussed:
* [Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/)
* [Transactional replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/administration/enhance-transactional-replication-performance?view=sql-server-2017)
* [Bulk load](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/bulk-insert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)

Data migration options, details, and supported versions are provided in the following table.

### Overview of prerequisites

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites. When upgrading from SQL Server on-premises or on SQL Server on Virtual Machines to and Azure SQL Database managed instance, there are prerequisites associated with:

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites for leveraging Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) for migrations. When upgrading from SQL Server on-premises or on SQL Server on Virtual Machines to Azure SQL Database, there are prerequisites associated with:
* Downloading and installing the [Data Migration Assistant (DMA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595).
* Creating an instance of Azure DMS (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/pre-reqs)).
* Using Azure DMS to perform online migrations (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-managed-instance-online#prerequisites)).
* Using Azure DMS to perform offline migrations (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance#prerequisites))



* Online migrations, see the information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-managed-instance-online#prerequisites).
* Offline migrations, see the information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance#prerequisites).

The tool optionally moves SQL Server native logins as well. Custom server and database roles are scripted, as well as role membership and database role and user permissions. Contained databases are yet not supported and only a subset of possible SQL Server permissions are scripted; i.e. permissions grant with grant are not supported (complex permission trees). More details are available in the support document and the script have comments for ease of understanding.</p>
