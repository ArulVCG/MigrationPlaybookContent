<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Additional resources

Be sure to check out the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator (Preview)](https://aka.ms/azure-tco) to help estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.

### Additional resources from real-world engagements

<p>This guide offers optimization advice for executing point-lookups against SQL Server from .NET as efficiently as possible. Customers wishing to migrate from mainframe databases to SQL Server may desire to migrate existing mainframe-optimized design patterns, especially when using 3rd party tools (such as Raincode Compiler) to automatically migrate mainframe code (COBOL/JCL, etc.) to T-SQL and C# .NET.</p>
