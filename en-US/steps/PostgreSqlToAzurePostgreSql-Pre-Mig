<!--Pre-migration overview-->

After verifying that your source environment is supported and ensuring that you have addressed any prerequisites, you are ready to start the Pre-migration stage. This part of the process involves conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate, assessing those databases for potential migration issues or blockers, and then resolving any items you might have uncovered. For heterogenous migrations (such as Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL), this stage also involves converting the schema(s) in the source database(s) to be compatible with the target environment. For homogenous migrations, such as PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, conversion of the source schema to work in the target environment is not required.
