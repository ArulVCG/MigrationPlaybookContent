<!--Data sync and Cutover-->

With minimal-downtime migrations, the source you are migrating continues to change, drifting from the target in terms of data and schema, after the one-time migration occurs. During the **Data sync** phase, you need to ensure that all changes in the source are captured and applied to the target in near real time. After you verify that all changes in source have been applied to the target, you can cutover from the source to the target environment.

For details on Data Sync and Cutover for this scenario, see the instructions in the [Perform migration cutover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-mysql-azure-mysql-online#perform-migration-cutover) section of the article Migrate MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL online using DMS.
