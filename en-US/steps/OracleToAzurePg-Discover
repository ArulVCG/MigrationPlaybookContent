<!--Discover-->

The goal of the Discover phase is to identify existing data sources and details about the features that are being used to get a better understanding of and plan for the migration. This process involves scanning the network to identify all your organizationâ€™s Oracle instances together with the version and features in use.

Microsoft Oracle pre-assessment scripts run against the Oracle database. The Pre-assessment script are a set of queries that hits the Oracle metadata and provides the following: 

- Database inventory, including counts of objects by schema, type, and status.
- A rough estimate of Raw Data in each schema (based on statistics).
- Sizing of tables in each schema.
- The number of lines of code per Package, Function, Procedure, etc.
