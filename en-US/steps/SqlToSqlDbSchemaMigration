<!--Migrate schema-->

After you are comfortable with the assessment and satisfied that the selected database is a viable candidate for migration to Azure SQL Database, use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to migrate the schema to Azure SQL Database.

**Note**: Before you create a migration project in DMA, be sure that you have already provisioned an Azure SQL database as mentioned in the prerequisites. If you use SSIS, DMA does not yet support the migration of source SSISDB, but you can redeploy your SSIS projects/packages to the destination SSISDB hosted by Azure SQL Database. For more information, see the **Migrate SSIS packages** section.

### Overview of schema migration steps

An overview of the steps associated with using DMA to migrate the schema follows.

1. Open DMA, and then begin creating a new migration project.
2. Specify a project name, select SQL Server as the source server type, and then select Azure SQL Database as the target server type.
3. Specify the migration scope as Schema only, and then create the project.
4. Specify the source connection details for your SQL Server, and then connect to the source database.
5. Specify the target connection details for the Azure SQL database, and then connect to the database you had pre-provisioned in Azure SQL Database.
6. Specify the schema objects in the source database that need to be deployed to Azure SQL Database.
7. Generate SQL scripts, and then review them for any errors.
8. Deploy the schema to Azure SQL Database, and then check the target server for any anomalies.
