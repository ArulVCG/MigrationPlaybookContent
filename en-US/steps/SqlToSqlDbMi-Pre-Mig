<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for migrating your SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, be sure to consider the versions of SQL Server that are supported and to address any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Offline versus online migrations
When you migrate SQL Server databases to Azure by using the Azure Database Migration Service, you can perform an offline or an online migration. With an *offline* migration, application downtime begins when the migration starts. For an *online* migration, downtime is limited to the time required to cut over to the new environment when the migration completes. It's recommended to test an offline migration to determine whether the downtime is acceptable; if not, perform an online migration.

The core charter DM Jumpstart is to unblock and accelerate complex modernization and compete data platform migration opportunities to Microsoftâ€™s Azure Data platform. If you think your organization would be interested in participating in the DM Jumpstart program, please contact your account team and ask that they submit a nomination.

### Overview of prerequisites

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites. When upgrading from SQL Server on-premises or on SQL Server on Virtual Machines to Azure SQL Database, there are prerequisites associated with:

* Creating an Azure Virtual Network (VNET) for the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
* Ensuring that your VNET Network Security Group rules don't block specific communication ports.
* Configuring your Windows Firewall for source database engine access.
* Opening your Windows Firewall to allow Azure DMS to access the source SQL Server.
* Creating an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.
* Ensuring that the logins used to connect the source SQL Server and target Managed Instance are members of the sysadmin server role.
* Creating a network share that Azure DMS can use to back up the source database.
* Ensuring that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write privileges on the network share that you created and that the computer account for the source server has read/write access to the same share.
* Making a note of a Windows user (and password) with full control privilege on the network share containing the backup of the source database.
* Creating a blob container and retrieving its SAS URI.

**Important**: For detail on the specific prerequisites associated with:

* Online migrations, see the information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-managed-instance-online#prerequisites).
* Offline migrations, see the information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance#prerequisites).
