<!--Preparing for database migration-->

As you prepare for migrating your database to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

## Overview

This scenario describes how to migrate a PostgreSQL instance to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Offline versus online migrations

For selected migration scenarios, Azure Database Migration Service supports both offline and online migrations. With an offline migration, application downtime begins when the migration starts. For an online migration, downtime is limited to the time required to cut over to the new environment when the migration completes.

**Important**: With PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL migrations, Azure Database Migration Service supports online migrations only.

## Supported versions

This section describes all supported scenarios and options for an upgrade from on-premises PostgreSQL versions to Azure Database for PostgreSQL. This information is current as of October 2019.

Details for migrations to Azure Database for PostgreSQL from the following PostgreSQL sources are included:

* PostgreSQL 9.5
* PostgreSQL 9.6
* PostgreSQL 10

You can migrate PostgreSQL running on-premises or on AWS RDS.

## Overview of prerequisites

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites for leveraging Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) for migrations. When upgrading from SQL Server on-premises or on SQL Server on Virtual Machines to Azure SQL Database, there are prerequisites associated with:

* Creating and instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-server-database-portal))
* Creating an instance of Azure Database Migration Service (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/pre-reqs)).
* Using Azure Database Migration Service to perform online migrations from:
  * PostgreSQL (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-postgresql-azure-postgresql-online#prerequisites)).
  * RDS PostgreSQL (detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-rds-postgresql-server-azure-db-for-postgresql-online#prerequisites)).
