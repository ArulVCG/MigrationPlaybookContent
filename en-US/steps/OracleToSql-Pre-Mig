<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Additional resources

Be sure to check out the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator (Preview)](https://aka.ms/azure-tco) to help estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.

### Migration learnings and best practices from real-world engagements

For additional assistance with completing this migration scenario, please see the following resources, which were developed in support of a real-world migration project engagement.

<p>This guide offers optimization advice for executing point-lookups against SQL Server from .NET as efficiently as possible. Customers wishing to migrate from mainframe databases to SQL Server may desire to migrate existing mainframe-optimized design patterns, especially when using 3rd party tools (such as Raincode Compiler) to automatically migrate mainframe code (COBOL/JCL, etc.) to T-SQL and C# .NET.</p>

<p>With Oracle, you can assign a non-scalar condition in the WHERE clause. However, SQL Server doesn&rsquo;t support this type of condition. As a result, SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;convert queries with a non-scalar condition in the WHERE clause, instead generating an error&nbsp;O2SS0001. This white paper provides more details on the issue and ways to resolve it.</p>
