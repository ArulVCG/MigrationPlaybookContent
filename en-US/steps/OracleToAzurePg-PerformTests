<!--Perform tests-->

After the data is migrated to target, perform tests against the databases to verify that the applications perform well against the after the migration.

To guarantee that the source and target are properly migrated, run the manual data validation scripts against the Oracle source and PostgreSQL target databases.

Ideally, if the source and target databases have a networking path, ora2pg should be used for data validation. Using the TEST action allows you to check that all objects from the Oracle database have been created under PostgreSQL. Run the command as shown:

```
ora2pg -t TEST -c config/ora2pg.conf > migration_diff.txt 
```
