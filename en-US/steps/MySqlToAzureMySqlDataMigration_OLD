<!--Migrate data-->

After the schema(s) is deployed, the next step is to migrate the data. There are two ways to migrate a MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

**For relatively small (<150GB for example) databases that allow for downtime during migration**, you can use dump and restore via the mysqldump utility and MySQL Workbench. For details, refer to the article [Dump and restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-migrate-dump-restore) in the Azure Database for MySQL documentation.

**For relatively large databases that canâ€™t afford downtime during migration**, see the detailed, step-by-step instructions in the article [Migrate MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL online using DMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-mysql-azure-mysql-online).
