## Assess and Convert

By using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Access, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate Access database objects to SQL Server, and then migrate data to SQL Server.

### Steps

To use SSMA for Access to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download [SSMA for Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54255)**, and then install it.

2. **Assess the source database**.

    a. Under File menu, click "New Project". Provide the details in the New Project dialog

    b. Click on "Add Databases" and select databases to be added to your new project
    
    ![Image Alt Text Add databases](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/accessadddb.png)
    
    c. In Access Metadata Explorer, select the database(s) that you want to assess
    
    ![Image Alt Text Select databases](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/accessselectdb.png)
    
    d. Right-click Databases, and select Create Report

3. **Converting Access Database Objects**. 

    a. Connect to SQL Azure target database
    
     ![Image Alt Text SQL Server conenction](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/accessconnecttosqlazure.png)
    
    b. In Access Metadata Explorer, expand access-metabase, and then expand Databases
       
    c. To convert database(s), select the check box next to Databases
      
    d. To convert schemas, right-click Databases and select Convert Schema
    
    ![Image Alt Text SQL Server conenction](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/accessconvertschema.png)

    Note: You can also convert individual objects. To convert an object, regardless of which objects are selected, right-click the object and select Convert Schema. 

    e. When an object has been converted, it appears bold in Access Metadata Explorer.
