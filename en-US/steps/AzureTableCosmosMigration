<!--Migrating from Azure Table Storage-->

There are two options available for migrating from Azure Table Storage to Azure Cosmos DB Table API. 

**Option #1: Move data using AZCopy** 

One option is to use the [AzCopy utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) to transfer data from
Azure Table Storage to Azure Cosmos DB. 

**Option #2: Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool**

The other option is the Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool, which is an open source solution that imports data to Azure Cosmos DB from a variety of sources, including: MongoDB, JSON files, SQL Server, etc. 
Follow the instructions in the article [Use Data migration tool to migrate your data to Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/import-data) on how to download and use the tool.

**Note**: If you are migrating from a data source that is not listed here to Azure Cosmos DB, please send an email to [AskCosmosDB@microsoft.com](mailto:AskCosmosDB@microsoft.com) and the product team will help you with migration.
