<!--Migrate schema and data-->

After assessing your databases, the next step is to execute the schema migration process. With the Azure Database Migration Service, schema migration takes place as part of the broader migration process.

**Important**: If you use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), DMS does not currently support migrating the catalog database for your SSIS projects/packages (SSISDB) from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. However, you can provision SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and redeploy your SSIS projects/packages to the destination SSISDB hosted by Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. For more information about migrating SSIS packages, see the article [Migrate SQL Server Integration Services packages to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/how-to-migrate-ssis-packages).
