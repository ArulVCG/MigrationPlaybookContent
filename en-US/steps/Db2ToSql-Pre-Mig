<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have address any prerequisites to help ensure a successful migration.

### Additional resources

- Be sure to check out the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://aka.ms/azure-tco) to help estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.
- For a matrix of the Microsoft and third-party services and tools that are available to assist you with various database and data migration scenarios as well as specialty tasks, see the article [Service and tools for data migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-tools-matrix).

### Migration learnings and best practices from real-world engagements

<p>After running the SQL script on a database, you can export the results to a file on the file system. Several file formats are supported, including *.csv, so that you can capture the results in external tools such as spreadsheets. This method can be useful if you want to more easily share results information with team who do not have the workbench installed.</p>
